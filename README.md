# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
Using Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL.

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project consists in visualize and show the differences among the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world.

## Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data needs to be obtained alongside with geographical coordinates from the USGS website in order to retrieve the magnitudes of earthquakes which will be added to a map. 

Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.So, Basil and Sadhana may be able to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. 

Finally, Basil and Sadhana would like to visualize all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. Therefore, a third map will need to be performed.
